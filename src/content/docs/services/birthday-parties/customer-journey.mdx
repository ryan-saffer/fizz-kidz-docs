        Sent automatically the moment a party is booked (both in-studio and
        at-home) so families have an authoritative receipt.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Recaps the booking details: date, time, studio, party type, and any
          known inclusions.
        </li>
        <li>
          Introduces the assigned studio manager as their single point of
          contact going forward.
        </li>
        <li>Explains the cancellation policy up front to set expectations.</li>
        <li>
          Includes critical links:

            <li>
              Party add-ons form used for birthday cakes (in-studio only) and
              take home bags.
            </li>
            <li>The invitation tool so they can message guests immediately.</li>
            <li>
              FAQ document plus photos of the studio they booked to answer
              common questions visually.

      </h3>
      <p>
        Exactly one week after booking, we check whether the family has
        purchased a cake or take home bags.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If nothing has been ordered yet and the main Party Form email has not
          gone out, send a reminder pointing back to the add-ons form.
        </li>
        <li>
          The message reinforces that cakes are only available for in-studio
          parties while take home bags are available for all.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once the Party Form has been sent (meaning the party is imminent) this
          reminder is suppressed to reduce inbox noise.
        </li>
      </ul>

      </h3>
      <p>
        Every Tuesday at 8:30 am, customers with parties happening the following
        week (10–12 days away) receive the Party Form.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Parent/guardian name and contact details so we know who is responsible
          on the day.
        </li>
        <li>Child name and age to tailor the experience.</li>
        <li>Expected number of kids attending for staffing and supplies.</li>
        <li>
          Selected creations and any premium upgrades so we can prepare the
          right materials.
        </li>
        <li>
          Additional food choices plus optional birthday cake requests (cakes
          restricted to in-studio bookings).
        </li>
        <li>Take home bag quantities or themes.</li>
        <li>Space to tell us about the child and ask any other questions.</li>
      </ul>
      <Aside type="caution" title="Payment & fulfilment rules">
        Cake or take home bag purchases trigger an immediate payment screen at
        the end of the Party Form. All other charges—price per head, extra food,
        and premium creations—stay unpaid until the party concludes. At-home
        parties never see cake options so we avoid unfulfillable orders.
      </Aside>
      <p>After submission, families receive a confirmation email that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Summarizes every selection so they can double-check details.</li>
        <li>
          Notes what has been pre-paid vs. what will be settled at the party.
        </li>
        <li>
          Spells out next steps: arrive 10 minutes early and bring cake plates
          for in-studio events, or set up a table with power and water access
          for at-home parties.

      <p>
        Six days later—Monday at 8:30 am—the system sends a nudge to parents who
        still have not completed the Party Form for the upcoming weekend.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Only the families who are missing submissions receive it, keeping
          inboxes tidy.

          It links back to the Party Form and reiterates why we need final

      <p>
        The day after the celebration, families receive a thank-you note asking
        them to leave a review.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Provides a direct review link plus an option to share private feedback
          if something needs a manager follow-up.
        </li>
        <li>
          Keeps the experience top-of-mind while memories (and photos) are still
          fresh.

## Notification automation map

Submitting or updating the Party Form also keeps internal teams in sync through targeted notifications:

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Repeat submission guardrails" icon="information">
    <p>
      If a customer fills out the Party Form again after already submitting it,
      email the studio manager with the discrepancies so they can confirm or
      action any last-minute changes.
    </p>
  </Card>
  <Card title="Food package changes" icon="warning">
    <p>
      Whenever the selected food package changes, alert the manager so they can
      make sure the kitchen and suppliers can accommodate the update.
    </p>
  </Card>
  <Card title="Creation count monitor" icon="puzzle">
    <p>
      If the customer requests more creations than the party length allows,
      notify the manager to call the parent and agree on a realistic plan.
    </p>
  </Card>
  <Card title="Parent question escalations" icon="open-book">
    <p>
      When parents leave questions in the form, email the manager with those
      notes and set the parent’s email as the reply-to so they can respond
      directly.
    </p>
  </Card>
  <Card title="Cake orders" icon="add-document">
    <p>
      Each cake order triggers a message to{" "}
      <code>orders@birthdaycakeshop.com.au</code> so the bakery can fulfil it on
      time.
    </p>
  </Card>
  <Card title="Take home bag orders" icon="approve-check-circle">
    <p>
      When take home bags are added, email the studio manager and{" "}
      <code>orders@brithdaycakeshop.com.au</code> with the quantities and any
      themes so fulfilment can begin.
