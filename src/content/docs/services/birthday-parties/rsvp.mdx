  <Card title="Create once, share anywhere" icon="instagram">
    <p>
      Hosts build an invitation, then share a link or download a printable
      version. Every printed invite includes a QR code that lands on the live
      web page.
    </p>
  </Card>
  <Card title="RSVPs stay in sync" icon="rocket">
    <p>
      Guests can RSVP directly on the invitation page - including multiple
      children at once - and their responses stay tied to the party, even if the
      host updates the invitation or swaps designs later.
    </p>
  </Card>
  <Card title="Automatic confirmations" icon="email">
    <p>
      Guests receive an email confirming their RSVP and are added to our mailing
      list. When enabled, hosts also get an email alert for each new response.
    </p>

  <Card title="Secure, role-aware access" icon="seti:lock">
    <p>
      Authentication decides what someone sees: guests get the RSVP form, hosts
      see the tracking dashboard, and staff signing in from the portal see the
      same tracking view on iPads.

## Guest experience

<Steps>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <h3>
        Open the invitation <Badge text="Link" variant="note" size="small" />{" "}
        <Badge text="QR code" variant="tip" size="small" />
      </h3>
      <p>
        Guests tap the shared link or scan the QR on a printed invite to load
        the live page with all party details and the invitation design the host
        selected.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Submit an RSVP for any children attending</h3>
      <p>
        The form accepts multiple children in one submission so families can
        reply once. Guests can include allergy details alongside their response.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Confirmation and notifications</h3>
      <p>
        After submitting, guests receive an email confirming their RSVP and are
        added to our mailing list. If the host chose notifications, they receive
        the same alert when a new RSVP arrives.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ol>
</Steps>

## Host view and controls

- Hosts must sign in or create an account before finalising an invitation so
  guest details stay protected.
- When a signed-in host opens their invitation link, they are taken to the RSVP
  management view instead of the guest form.
- Hosts can review every RSVP, edit entries, or delete responses as needed.
- Invitations can be edited or redesigned at any time without losing RSVP data;
  existing printed QR codes keep pointing to the right page.
- Only the invitation owner can make edits once it is created.

<Aside type="tip" title="Keep designs fresh without risk">
  Swapping to a new invitation template never breaks the QR codes that were
  already handed out - guests still land on the current invitation and their
  responses remain intact.
</Aside>

## Staff access

Staff can open the invitation from the portal on iPads (while signed in) to see
the same tracking view as hosts. This list helps the team gauge expected head
count and check allergy requirements before the party.

## Security rules

<Aside type="caution" title="Authentication first">
  All RSVP data is protected. Every invitation requires the host to be signed in
  before it can be finalised or edited, and only the owner can make changes. The
  live page adapts to the viewer - guests get the RSVP form, while hosts and
  staff see the tracking view after authenticating.
