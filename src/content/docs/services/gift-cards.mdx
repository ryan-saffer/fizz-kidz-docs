#### Fizz Kidz uses Square e-gift cards so customers can buy once and redeem at any studio.

<Aside type="danger" title="Sell only via the website">
  Process every gift card sale through the online gift card site and never
  through the Square point of sale app.
</Aside>

- [Buy, reload, or check balances here](https://app.squareup.com/gift/3BYCWGK2H0SXV/order)
- E-gift cards are the only option; physical cards are not supported yet.
- Since gift cards can be redeemed at any studio, sales route to a dedicated 'Fizz Kidz HQ' Square location.

<Aside type="note" title="Why are sales routed through Fizz Kidz HQ?">
  Selling directly through a studio, such as via the Square POS, would credit
  that studio even though the card can be redeemed anywhere, forcing studios to
  settle up with each other. Keeping all sales on the gift card website prevents
  cross-studio money movement and avoids disputes. Physical cards are paused
  until a clean, shared solution is in place.

## How purchasing works

Customers can:

- Buy for themselves or as a gift and send via email or text.
- Invite multiple contributors to pool funds onto one gift card.
- Reload an existing card or check the balance from the same link.

## Redemption options

- **Online checkout**: accepted for Holiday Program or Play Lab bookings.
- **In studio**: accepted at the point of sale. [Follow Square’s steps here to accept a gift card in studio](https://squareup.com/help/au/en/article/8404-accept-gift-cards)

## How franchisees receive funds

- Gift card sales settle to Fizz Kidz HQ, not the studio where the card is sold or redeemed.
- At month end, HQ runs a redemption report by location and pays out each studio for the value redeemed, minus Square fees.
- Studios do not receive funds at the time of redemption; the month-end payout handles reimbursement.
