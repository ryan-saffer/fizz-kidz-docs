import { Aside } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

Acuity Scheduling is the platform we use to accept and manage bookings for our classes, including holiday programs, after school programs, and Play Lab.

<Aside type="note" title="Payments not accepted through Acuity">
It powers scheduling and capacity tracking only. Payments always go through Square.

## Logging in

Staff sign in at [secure.acuityscheduling.com/appointments.php](https://secure.acuityscheduling.com/appointments.php) to access calendars and appointment details.

## Where bookings happen

- Customers book through the Fizz Kidz Portal, which integrates with Acuity to create and update appointments behind the scenes.
- The only time families touch the Acuity website is to change or cancel holiday program or Play Lab sessions. Their confirmation email includes a link to the Acuity-hosted page where they can reschedule or cancel. If they cancel, Acuity notifies the Fizz Kidz Portal so it can send the confirmation and handle refunds.
- We do not use Acuity’s checkout or payment tools. All transactions run in Square.

## Checking capacity as staff

- In Acuity, open the **Calendar** view on the left, then switch to **Week View** or **Month View** for a snapshot of upcoming sessions and how full they are.
- From that calendar you can cancel or reschedule appointments if needed, keeping in mind the portal will handle any downstream emails and refunds after a cancellation.
