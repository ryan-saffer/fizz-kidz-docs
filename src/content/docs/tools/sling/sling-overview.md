Sling is the workforce management platform we use to roster, communicate, and coordinate every casual staff member across Fizz Kidz. You can browse their full support centre at <a href="https://support.getsling.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">support.getsling.com</a>, but this page covers how we use Sling internally.

## One account, many locations

- All studios operate inside a single Fizz Kidz Sling account so rosters, payroll integrations, and reporting stay centralised.
- Staff are granted access only to their home location. They cannot view or edit shifts outside that site unless they are explicitly given multi-location access.
- Roles fall into two buckets:
  - **Staff** can view their roster, acknowledge shifts, and message the team.
  - **Managers** can publish rosters, review wages, approve time off, and coordinate messaging for their location.

## Everyday use

- Sling is our only rostering tool for casual employees; every shift must be created and published here.
- Internal announcements, DMs, and group chats all run through Sling’s messaging so we keep conversations tied to the roster context.
- Payroll is generated directly from the published roster. Stay aligned with the guidance in [Sling payroll](/tools/sling/sling-payroll) for shift naming and integrations.
- Budget estimates rely on the wage data synced from Xero each Friday. See [Sling budgeting](/tools/sling/sling-budgeting) for how those numbers work and common variances.
- Staff request time away through Sling’s **Time Off** feature. The **Unavailability** module is disabled because it does not support our process. Time off requests must be submitted at least 14 days in advance and approved by a manager; approved entries help roster planners avoid clashes.

## Guardrails

- Do **not** add, edit, or delete shift types or locations. Finance maintains these to keep the payroll integration stable.
- Keep roster edits inside your assigned location unless you have explicit approval to support another site.
- Review the published roster before payroll cut-off so the integration exports the correct shifts and pay codes.
